# WARNING - THE APP IS CURRENTLY BROKEN

See [#3](https://github.com/codeka/weather/issues/3), but basically after [weather underground shut down their API](https://apicommunity.wunderground.com/weatherapi/topics/end-of-service-for-the-weather-underground-api), we broke.

# Android Weather Widget

Pretty basic weather widget, has just the features I want and nothing else. Uses Weather
Underground as it's main data source. Some screenshots:
